0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much

4,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
5,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
6,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
7,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
8,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
9,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
10,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
11,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
12,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
13,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
14,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
15,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
16,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
17,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
18,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
19,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
20,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
21,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
22,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
23,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
24,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
25,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
26,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
33,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
34,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
35,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
36,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
37,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
38,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
39,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
40,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
41,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
42,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
43,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
44,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
45,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
46,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
47,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
48,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
49,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
50,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
51,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
52,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
53,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
54,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
55,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
56,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
57,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
58,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
59,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
60,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
61,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
62,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
63,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
64,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
65,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
66,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
67,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
68,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
69,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•..

70,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
71,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
72,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."

74,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
75,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you.

76,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use.

78,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
79,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
80,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
81,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
82,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
83,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
84,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
85,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
86,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5.

87,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected.

88,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
89,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
90,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
91,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
92,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
93,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram

It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow.

All the operations like copy, paste,file unzipping takes more than 2hours. So within one week I have added sdd storage, since it has the compartment for sdd(cost:3k).Now it's super cool laptop at this price. I can able to do multitasking.

Without SSD its very slow, but yiu can still run a lot of things on it, just that yiu have to wait longer on loading screens. My boot time before ssd was around 1.5 to 2 mins, after I put Crucial P5 m.2 nvme ssd , now my boot time is 12 to 15 seconds. The display and keybord are perfect.

103,3,I m giving a honest review..I m using this laptop for 1 month now..it's not that much fast as I expected..betery quality is good..when I use c++ or Java it's gives a decent experience..but sometimes it takes so much time to start..
104,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
105,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
106,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
107,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...
108,5,"After upgrading the ram to 16 gb... All games for this specification works fine. I played few games including pubg pc, warzone, gta v , wolfenstein young blood, gears 5 .. all of them work great in this laptop"
109,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
110,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
111,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
112,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
113,1,Could be better. For solid works it's lagging. I don't know if it can support GTA 5 with ultra graphics. Audio is very disappointing..
114,1,Battery gets drained pretty quick you charge it to 100% and play for 2 hrs and that's it. Well coming to display you will be able to see screen bleed towards edges the processor is good for the price paid and overall you can play almost heavy games better if you add SSD to improve overall performance just battery and display is only concern rest all is pretty good for the price.
115,1,"This is not about the replacement product that I have now.. But about the piece that they delivered first... Everything about it was horrible.... Performance:- 1.

Toshiba hard disc: 71.8 (67%)  Overall- 31st percentile (way below expectations) Everything except the hard disc were horrible/below avg..

So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
118,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
119,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching

It takes nearly 3-5 mins just to switch on (even after minimizing almost all startup apps after consulting HP Customer Service. App loading is very slow.

For Those who don't Know out of 8 Gb 2.1 GB of Ram is totally occupied by The Vram of the Cpu, So u are left with 5.88 GB of Ram. Now The game still runs like GTA 5.  But The Issue comes with HDD being 5400 Rpm its less. Its Pc performance degrades. You will see windows starting little late, application taking time to open. Also GTA 5 st..."
124,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
125,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."

127,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
128,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
129,5,"Wonderful gaming laptop,upgrade the ram to 16gb but it supports until 32gb , ssd then this absolute stunning machine, coding wise this doesnt lag even a little bit. gaming still havent tested yet but the nvidia graphics card 1650 is really awesome , 4k videos run cool"
130,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected.

131,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
132,4,"Honestly, this is a good laptop for multitasking and heavy gaming. But it also has some issues which is need to fixed. I highly suggest you to upgrade RAM (16GB) and SSD.  PROS: 1.

136,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
137,1,It might have great specs but it is slower than 4GB Ram laptops my friends are having. If you are from computer science background tell me how much time should a system take to import a small library like pandas mayb seconds. But it will take 2-3 minutes. It is that slow. Trust me.
138,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that.

162,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
163,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
164,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
165,4,"I have reviewed this product after 7 days. First we should update latest version of nvidia gpu and amd Radeon versions and additionally windows updates also. I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings. If I played this game for long hour, laptop automatically locks and hibernate itlsef it is a major issue in this laptop. Additionally u need 8 gb ram to play high end games without laaging, sluttering and smooth. This laptop have hdd capacity boot up time..."
166,5,Very nice product in this price range.
167,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
168,5,Beast with beauty
169,5,"This HP laptop is specifically bought for my daughter for her engineering studies as she has to make graphic designs using Solidworks, PTC Creo and Ansys. Ideal computer for Engineering students."
170,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
171,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
172,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
173,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
174,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
175,5,Just wow! üòç
176,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
177,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
178,1,I have Changed my review from 5 star to one... DUE TO BUILD QUALITY. AFTER using for 2 weeks. The build of this laptop showed its colours. Its very bad. The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre. They said the build quality is not promising. but laptop is functional. So poor Feel from this laptop. Look wise its good. no issues. But the feel is totally destroyed coz of...
179,5,"Best Laptop Ever. I thought the HDD would be slow, but it's booting in 15 seconds. battery backup also fine, I'll Upgrade to SSD and 16 GB ram. it'll be The best ever."

181,2,Booting is very very slow
182,5,Nice product and nice luking
183,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
184,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
185,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
186,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
187,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
188,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
189,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud
190,5,Asowm
191,5,Very good product and less price
192,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.

198,1,i dont know why but my laptop is very slow i know there is no ssd but this us too much.. it takes time even to open My pc üò≠üò≠
199,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good. Looks premium but it is made full of plastic and one thing I don't like is that p..."
200,5,It's awesome...
201,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.

203,5,VERY AWESOME LAPTOP..  BEST LAPTOP IN THIS RANGE  VERY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE
204,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
205,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
206,1,This laptop is too too slow from 1st day.
207,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
208,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
209,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
210,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
211,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
212,5,Awesome laptop
213,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
214,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
215,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."

225,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram.

288,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
289,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
290,5,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
291,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
292,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
293,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.

294,5,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
295,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
296,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.

About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."

You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget.

If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"

Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."

Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."

393,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
394,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."

For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
399,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."

Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
402,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."

419,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
420,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth.

Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
432,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted.

433,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good.

I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products.

482,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
483,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"

485,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
486,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

498,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product.

550,5,"Got this product on Big Billion Days offer for Rs.44,900. That's probably the most excellent offer considering it's retail value at 66K. This is my experience after 15 days of use.  About the product,  DESIGN - With the everyone's favorite beautiful apple logo, it's got premium touch. It's well built. Its Sleek. It's Elegant. One of the most beautiful machine you'd ever get your hands on to. Ultra slim. Ultra light. You'd barely feel any weight of your bag. Extremely portable. If you are a ..."

And I don't think I will ever be.  Q. Why this laptop? A. I was looking for laptop which would allow me to my daily casual stuff, like surfing the net, replying emails, presentations, and yes one very important aspect, I love carrying my laptop around because of me travelling often, so a long battery life..."

557,5,"Fast boot time , excellent display, no slowness, definitely good."
558,4,"It gives me nearly 7 hrs of battery life when I stream on YouTube, Viki etc. Even though it's only dual core yet I have never faced any kind of lag. Best thing is, if you want to do video editing it comes preloaded with iMovie, which in my opinion gets the job done for most of the people who edit videos."

600,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
601,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...

611,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac.

728,5,i bought it for 48090 using exchange offer and for that price it is awsome laptop premium built and very light weight and flipkart delivery was also good as i got it in about 4 days
729,5,Amazing Product at amazing price 44k on billion days sell.

731,5,amazing and so nice and slim laptop.
732,5,"I was a skeptic regarding Mac. Why is it so costly? Turns out, you get exactly what you pay for. A premium looking laptop with great quality and battery life. After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."
733,2,"I have used all Apple products and my experience is quite satisfactory. But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."

742,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
743,5,Cool üòéüòé nice product
744,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
745,1,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
746,1,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
747,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
748,2,It work slow
749,1,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
750,1,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
751,5,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
752,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
753,1,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
754,4,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
755,1,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
756,5,"Good service , good product, Happy with Purchase..."
757,5,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
758,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."

769,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."

813,1,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."

As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
926,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

953,5,Awesome
954,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
955,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!

957,3,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
958,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
959,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

998,2,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
999,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
1000,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."

1004,5,Simply Awesome
1005,5,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
1006,5,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.

1013,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
1014,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
1015,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."

Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours.

1025,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
1026,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..

1031,5,Impressive!!!
1032,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.

1034,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
1035,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
1036,1,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
1037,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
1038,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
1039,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
1040,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
1041,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
1042,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
1043,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
1044,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
1045,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
1046,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
1047,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
1048,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
1049,5,nice prodect
1050,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
1051,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
1052,1,Good product but price varies
1053,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
1054,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
1055,3,Great
1056,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
1057,4,Amazing quality
1058,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
1059,5,Very nice products.
1060,5,Good but price high
1061,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
1062,5,Perfect
1063,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
1064,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
1065,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
1066,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
1067,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
1068,1,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
1069,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
1070,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
1071,1,charget not found
1072,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
1073,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
1074,2,I think window is better system Crashes
1075,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
1076,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
1077,5,Superb product
1078,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
1079,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
1080,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
1081,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
1082,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
1083,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
1084,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
1085,5,Stunningly superb
1086,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
1087,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
1088,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
1089,4,It's a good product but not value for money
1090,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
1091,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
1092,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
1093,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
1094,1,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
1095,1,not good quality
1096,5,awesome product saves lot of time
1097,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
1098,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
1099,3,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

1144,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

1158,5,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

1193,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

1259,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself
1260,5,No comments !! It's a macbook !!!!!
1261,5,Value for money

1333,5,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
1334,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."

1358,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app).

1387,4,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october.

1396,5,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
1397,4,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
1398,4,Awsm!

1423,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
1424,5,Amazing
1425,5,Good perched
1426,5,One if the best purchase
1427,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
1428,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
1429,1,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display

1432,5,"Loved it!  Delivery executive was way too generous and soft spoken. Both, product and flipkart services (seller inclusive) are superb. Packaging was outstanding. Keep up the good work. Thanks for your service!"
1433,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.

1442,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.

1447,5,"Having purchased the Mac Book Air, my friend asked me how it is and I just replied with a single word - ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù  That having said, I read above reviews already given and everything about the Mac book Air looks good and many have said that the display could be better but I personally am satisfied with this MacBook. The model is 2017 which misses the fingerprint and Retina display from 2018 model. Pretty decent for android studio for mobile app development. The power on time is impressively lo..."
1448,5,Battery was awesome.. Performance management was really good. Note* Not for gamers.. Rest go blindly...
1449,5,Good laptop. I got it for 56k worth it. Display is not great. You can buy lifetime subscription of office at 2000 for those who are worried about office.
1450,1,I have purchased the product but the screen gets off in between automatically and also when i touch the screen it gives electric shock sometimes
1451,5,Awesome

1469,5,Very good product value for money tough build quality and also give smoother performance
1470,3,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.
1471,5,Mind blowing super.

1491,5,The packaging n product quality is awsone. Will revert on its functioning in due course
1492,5,"I was sceptical about buying a macbook first, but I never regretted buying one. If you are in a dilemma whether to go do this or another option. Just go for this."
1493,5,Light as a notebook. Great battery life. Superb performance.
1494,5,Wonderful product by apple sure to sugest other
1495,5,I brought it to study reactjs and do some web development it‚Äôs working good as of now
1496,5,Good quality
1497,5,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
1498,5,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
1499,5,Nice product
1500,4,Very very bad display looks are excellent performance is excellent battery life and so too good but this place I have ever seen in this price range

1503,5,Super as thin as air
1504,4,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
1505,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
1506,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1507,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
1508,5,Worthy of money
1509,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
1510,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
1511,5,Fall in love with this
1512,5,Good
1513,1,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
1514,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
1515,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
1516,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
1517,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
1518,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
1519,5,Nice product
1520,5,"Great product, my daughter love it."

1525,5,Worth
1526,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
1527,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
1528,4,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
1529,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
1530,5,Good
1531,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
1532,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
1533,4,good
1534,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
1535,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
1536,5,Macbook air is awesome.
1537,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
1538,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
1539,5,Best
1540,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
1541,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
1542,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
1543,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
1544,1,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
1545,5,Good
1546,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
1547,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
1548,5,Great product. Just loving it.
1549,5,Nice
1550,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
1551,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
1552,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
1553,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
1554,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
1555,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
1556,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
1557,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
1558,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
1559,5,Very good
1560,5,Good Product.
1561,3,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
1562,5,Beautiful
1563,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
1564,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
1565,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
1566,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
1567,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

1609,4,"Best quality, worth of money."
1610,5,A wonderful product.
1611,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
1612,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
1613,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
1614,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
1615,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
1616,5,Great laptop even in 2020
1617,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

1738,5,Best in the business.
1739,5,Great experience.
1740,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
1741,5,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy
1742,4,Worth of money
1743,5,it is best for carrying. battery is good
1744,5,good product at great price
1745,5,very good
1746,4,nice one but seems cant travel with in flight due to battery issues
1747,5,This is one of the best apple device in this price..
1748,5,The Best
1749,5,super
1750,5,üñ§üñ§üñ§ loved this
1751,5,Working Amazingly in 2019. Seller TruCom Retail delivered the product as expected.. Thanks for providing original Laptop.
1752,2,I have purchased Mac Book Air online but after 2 days Mac Book Air Screen got vertical line. Its very tough to purchase through e-commerce.

1754,5,Fantastic
1755,5,This product is very good .
1756,5,Very nice product
1757,1,Gets heated when charged
1758,2,Dear all. When I placed the order I was very confused about the quality and authenticity of the product. So after receiving the package I directly went to the Apple service Center and got my Mac book check. It is 100%genuine product.
1759,5,just amazing than i expected..it is just crowd puller laptop when you go to public places.feels so premium no windows laptop can compete this laptop in design performance .
1760,5,good

1762,4,Battery backup is too good.
1763,5,its just awsum .Nothing beats apple as far as performance is concerned
1764,5,what can be better
1765,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
1766,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
1767,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
1768,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
1769,5,Value for money.
1770,5,Super in less price than uttar pradesh also delhi I suggest to buy online

2353,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.

2486,5,Tnx
2487,5,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not? However, this piece of beauty is well equipped to go smoothly with my expectations of a big clear display, clear voice and word/pdf typing/reading works. A word of caution to the gamers though..

6860,1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
6861,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
6862,5,Awesome laptops I love it Performance is very nice 1 day delivered Really I love it Thank you for Flipkart

Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...
6866,4,Best budget laptop if you just need it for basic use and zoom meetings .. satisfied with the product .. recommended

6887,4,Good Laptop for Beginners...
6888,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.

7558,4,Works fine for the Greta price point. For anything more than MS office use the performance will be slower.  The build quality for the feel looks a bit flimsy. The plastic material looks a bit light. And not solid as the thinkpad i am used to. But overall good buy for online school classes.

Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."

I'm personally not satisfied with this product.
7820,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
7821,1,I am not satisfied with this laptop.this laptop is working slow. Screen brightness is low. Speaker is not good sound is low.i get this laptop in 26k. After 1 year keyboard and touchpad not working overall i am not satisfied with this laptop.
7822,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
7823,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
7824,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
7825,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
7826,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
7827,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
7828,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
7829,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
7830,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
7831,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
7832,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
7833,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
7834,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
7835,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
7836,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
7837,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
7838,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
7839,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
7840,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
7841,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
7842,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
7843,4,"It's a good laptop, ideal for students and office work. But it's not for coding and programming 4gb ram is less for this. Initially the laptops hangs and a bit slow but after all the security patch and windows update it runs completely fine. Battery life is not as good also AMD processor consume more power and camera is really bad.Also this colour gets dirty very easily. Till now I'm not finding any more problem. I'm writing this review after 10days. I got it for rs.31,990/ at this price this..."
7844,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
7845,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
7846,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
7847,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
7848,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
7849,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
7850,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
7851,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
7852,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
7853,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
7854,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
7855,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
7856,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
7857,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation.

7858,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."

Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
7861,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
7862,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

7919,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
7920,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
7921,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.

Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
7947,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
7948,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
7949,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
7950,1,Simply waste
7951,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
7952,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
7953,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
7954,3,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
7955,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
7956,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
7957,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
7958,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
7959,5,Go for it.
7960,5,Good
7961,5,Nice
7962,4,Nice
7963,5,Osome product
7964,5,Nice
7965,4,Good laptop in this budget...
7966,5,Awesome
7967,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
7968,3,Little bit slower but value for money
7969,4,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº
7970,2,It hangs anytime....and shut down.... processer is slow
7971,2,Slowüëé
7972,4,Nice laptop but battery not good!!
7973,3,Laptop is very good and slower in system üòâüòâüòâüòâü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§≠ü§≠
7974,4,Camera is worst but laptop is best for all type of use
7975,3,Average performance. Poor battery charge. Good laptop for light work.
7976,5,Worth for price !
7977,2,Everything is good.. except its hanging problem... It hangs a lot... Sometimes its very irritating while working on it... I don't know what's wrong....
7978,5,Good
7979,5,Nice product
7980,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
7981,4,Best buy for this budget
7982,5,My use is only for drafting I use only ms office For me it's good.
7983,3,Ok product
7984,4,"With this price it is better then others, look and color are really good."
7985,5,It's great in this price (26000)
7986,5,"I m using from past 2 months, and must say this is the best laptop under 30k. Very useful for students and people working from home. I felt a problem of low display, otherwise the laptop is best in this range."

7993,5,I m satisfied for this product
7994,5,Good time delivery....
7995,1,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

8005,5,Amazing performance üëåüëåüëåüëå
8006,3,Ok
8007,4,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."
8008,3,"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good"

8033,1,It's just maximum 10bdays to bought. But it going to start to hang.. Sometimes screen become statue.. I am not going to recommend this product. Waste of money. Unfortunately I can't showing by image.
8034,2,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
8035,2,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."

8545,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
8546,4,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
8547,4,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
8548,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
8549,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
8550,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
8551,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
8552,4,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
8553,5,Nice phone i am very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
8554,3,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
8555,5,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
8556,4,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
8557,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
8558,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
8559,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
8560,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
8561,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
8562,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
8563,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
8564,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
8565,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
8566,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
8567,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
8568,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
8569,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
8570,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
8571,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
8572,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
8573,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
8574,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
8575,5,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
8576,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
8577,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
8578,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
8579,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
8580,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
8581,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
8582,5,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
8583,3,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
8584,4,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
8585,4,Nice üëç product at this prize battery is amazing but display quality is as compair to other mi phone not God but nice at this prize range
8586,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
8587,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
8588,5,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

8589,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
8590,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
8591,5,Its a great phone at this price range. Worth the price.. amazing camera. Lovely built quality. Loved it!
8592,5,At this price it's a very good product. The quality of its camera is fantastic and battery backup is also good. What i love most about this product is the display superb display full of HD.
8593,5,"If you need a good battery backup for 2 days it's a Excellent device having good processor, but if you are a Music Lover need good high pitch and volume you will be upset. Brightness in sun is also low."
8594,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
8595,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone.

8596,3,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
8597,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
8598,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
8599,3,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
8600,4,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
8601,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

9160,3,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel. Brightness level is also very low in daylight even after it is full. Battery is Ok but to full charge it takes almost 2 hours 45 minutes.
9161,1,Please don't exchange Mobile on Flipkart they are cheat us
9162,5,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
9163,2,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
9164,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage
9165,5,Delivered in just 2 days. Good looking. ‚ú® Better battery backup. Faster. Worth the moneyüëå Sd processor is worth with lesser phone heat. Perfect pick for homemaker womanüë©

If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

This mobile magar problem is hanging some time my mobile screen is full whight and some time mobile touch Not working and wifi also not good wifi connectivity also not good. Mobile camera is average this mobile is good for Lite users. I don't think I buy any redmi mobile in future. I am also use realme 2pro mobile 3 yers but i am not facing any problem. But i am buy redmi mobile every time i am regret buy I am buy redmi...
10180,4,Very good
10181,3,Three star because of Display Brightness is low and poor compare to other same range mobile. Lens of front camera take more space on display. Unwanted application pre installed that i dont want. Also big problem is system and miui are consume more space from memory. 50% space consume only required app. Google general dialer is very poor.

12200,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
12201,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
12202,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
12203,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
12204,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
12205,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
12206,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
12207,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
12208,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
12209,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
12210,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
12211,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
12212,3,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit . And osm think is** new advance system is osmü§© ,, *& according to me its good average phone ,, # if you spend more money then i recommend you buy other one üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
12213,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
12214,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
12215,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
12216,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
12217,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
12218,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
12219,5,"Best üëç for who want a stock android phone lovers.., value for money üí∞ I love this one.., Everything is cool and clean I like the software. Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"
12220,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
12221,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
12222,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
12223,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
12224,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1. First ever in stock android I've seen companies software not ..."
12225,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
12226,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
12227,4,First of all I really love Motorola This phone is really impressive with its design with its specifications its camera nd most powerful nd loved one is its pure stock android experience with moto customisation options there is no blootwere no adds no lags its pros nd now we discuss about its cons the review is true nd based on i m using various type of phone in this segment nd i also use motorola's many pjones   So the main nd major problem with motorola is hd+ display its really i feel if m...
12228,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
12229,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
12230,2,"You can not get the phone flip cover easily, packings was wast even first time I have seen that ther was not bubbles rap on phone,looks like that packing was totally mess..phone performance is cute good however you will get the more Phone in less price.."
12231,5,Best phone for normal usersüíØ.  üî¥Note:- This is the review after using it for 1 day.  I have ordered this for my parents and it is best phone for them.  üîä Sound quality(loudness) is average to good. üîã Battery backup is also greatüíØ Easily handle 14 to 20 hrs with continuous usage of data and hotspot. üîå Charging speed is also average to good.

12232,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
12233,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
12234,4,"Build quality 5  Display 5  Colors 3  Storage capacity 5  Performance 4 (Because phone becomes slightly slow while performing multiple functions)  Camera 4 (Because night clicks are not at all up to the mark, daylight shots are clean but you get best quality only in 64 pixel shots, normal clicks would have been better)  Battery 5 absolutely amazing.

12235,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."
12236,5,"Very good Phone for gifting to elders, because of super clean software with no spoofs, a very long lasting battery and super fast and responsive display. Excellent for doing everyday tasks. Not so good for performance tasks,or for camera folks"
12237,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."
12238,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
12239,5,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes. Camera quality is excellent only lag of focus white shooting videos. UI is pure no adds, no third party apps. Overall performance is good. I am writing this after using for more than 20 days."
12240,4,"Its a good phone for the price. Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good. One ..."
12241,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
12242,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
12243,5,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
12244,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
12245,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
12246,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
12247,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
12248,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
12249,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
12250,1,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
12251,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
12252,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
12253,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
12254,4,Hmm... Well it's good for less usage definitely not recommending to people who always stick on their phonesüçÅ best for mothers and grandparents kind of...
12255,5,Wonderful product of Motorola G30 very best quality and best performance really i am very happy to purchase this product fully satisfied in this prices Very very thank you so much flippant. Com online shopping companies are very best and bileeve for my next shopping programs
12256,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
12257,4,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
12258,5,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."

Camera is good, not the best but works Excellent with Google camera so you can download from xforum.

Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again. Motorola need to work on processing speed otherwise it's just waste of money. 2. Brightness: Very week. Bt ..."
12267,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand. Build quality is good. I have few other moto phones running without any issue after even 4 years of rough use. The camera is average and could be improved.

12268,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
12269,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.
12270,3,"Recommended only for those who are love stock android experience. G30's camera and screen resolution üëéüëéüëé My 1st aim to buy these phone for stock android experience.

12273,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.

12275,5,The most attractive part of this phone is its battery backup..nice premium quality photos and interesting features in it..overall loved the phone and would say its too good and evry penny spent on it is worth it
12276,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs. 2. Slow charging.

12354,1,"Camera quality is okay but pics/vids occupy more space than expected as per the quality of photos.It provides no gallery of its own that's very annoying.Overall phone is less customisable. 64GB for 11k is really expensive, out of which only 48Gb is usable, it isn't Value for Money tbh."

Almost using 100+ apps on it . Touch & screen quality is best. Hybrid sim slots but am using two sims instead of MMC card. Finger print sensor is a quick. Face unlock is a bit slow. Have played games without a lag ...I have ordered dark pearl 64 gb ."

12379,1,"Until now I used Moto G (Firsts Generation) for almost 7 years now and it still works like a charm.. but to upgrade I bought this new Moto G30 thinking it is going to be far better than its predecessors, but it's the worst phone ever by motorola. It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."

12383,5,"I am editing this review after 6months of usage.  At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."
12384,1,"Hybrid slot, not good compare to other phones. Camera also not good. Hanging problem"
12385,5,Very best quality
12386,1,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
12387,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."

Display is not HD+, for this price they can at least provide HD+ display.  Final verdict: Good mobile packed with everything for a reasonable price."

12418,4,Overall Good phone
12419,5,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
12420,4,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
12421,2,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...

12424,5,"I think this is by far the best phone out there in this price range only because of its clean and near stock user interface. No bloatware, No BS. Just plain stock experience."
12425,5,This is my 6th moto phone in last 11 years. Still the same quality.
12426,5,Nice Phone but camera quality is not too good
12427,3,Camera is 64mp but its not good .clearity of camera was disappointed... Not upto the mark and picture clearity is not good. Worst camera clearity and features.

12454,5,Good product compared to it's price. I think this is the first device to have advanced security(Think shield) for budget device. SAMSUNG provides knox security only for premium device
12455,5,Very good mobile! When I bought this phone gpay QR code does not work now the problem is solved by Motorola updated thank you Motorola network speed is little slow may be because of processor hope this will also solve soon I love the phone 'cause the name is MOTOROLA!

12471,2,I am not satisfied this product
12472,1,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
12473,2,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
12474,1,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
12475,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
12476,1,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
12477,5,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.

12483,3,"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
12484,1,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
12485,3,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."
12486,3,Average performance
12487,1,Camera quality is poor...don't buy from flipkart..they don't refund the money

12496,1,"Mobile hanging, while Gpay barcode scanner unable to scan again hang, after taking image, while image open again hang, sound on full volume became broken speaker like sound come, one Sim and one memory card or 2 Sim at a time, camera image size around 4-5mb by which stores more space on mobile memory. selfy camera image quality not good"
12497,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
12498,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
12499,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .
12500,1,Very bad performance app shut on its own i complained but no response from company very bad services

12504,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
12505,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
12506,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
12507,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
12508,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
12509,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

12516,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
12517,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."
12518,3,"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

12560,1,"After using turbocharger for two hours, the battery does not get charged to 100%. It gets discharged very fast. I replaced my earlier phone mainly for this reason. Thoroughly disappointed."

It provides only 22 hrs with minimal usage and discharges from 14 to 20 percent during night even no apps running in background and mobile data is off. Also has heating issue as the temperature raises up to 46 celcius with light game only. Tried to replace the product but very poor benchmarking during evaluation. My fate to use.

12756,5,Great Phone for the price especially for those who want an Adfree/ bloat free experience. I bought this for my mom and I don't want to bother her with Adwares and other creepy apps.  Snapdragon 662 is snappy for everyday use and also for playing some heavy games at medium settings. The HD+ IPS display is bright with good color reproduction and brightness. 90 Hz refresh rate is an added advantage. Camera is not that great but good. The processor is capable of 4K video record...

12906,5,Review after using for 3 months:  Pros: 1. Definitely lives up to motorola's legacy of solid build quality 2. Awesome performance without any overheating (1 hour of BGMI makes it heat slightly but not overheat) 3. Superb battery life (consumed only 3% battery on playing BGMI for 30m) 4. Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1. Camera is decent overall with great shots in day and night light but performs...

13770,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
13771,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
13772,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
13773,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
13774,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
13775,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
13776,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
13777,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
13778,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
13779,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
13780,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
13781,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
13782,3,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit .

13783,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
13784,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
13785,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
13786,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
13787,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
13788,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
13789,5,"Best üëç for who want a stock android phone lovers.., value for money üí∞ I love this one.., Everything is cool and clean I like the software. Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"
13790,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
13791,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
13792,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
13793,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
13794,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1. First ever in stock android I've seen companies software not ..."
13795,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
13796,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
13797,4,First of all I really love Motorola This phone is really impressive with its design with its specifications its camera nd most powerful nd loved one is its pure stock android experience with moto customisation options there is no blootwere no adds no lags its pros nd now we discuss about its cons the review is true nd based on i m using various type of phone in this segment nd i also use motorola's many pjones   So the main nd major problem with motorola is hd+ display its really i feel if m...
13798,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
13799,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."

13801,5,Best phone for normal usersüíØ.  üî¥Note:- This is the review after using it for 1 day.

13802,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
13803,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
13804,4,"Build quality 5  Display 5  Colors 3  Storage capacity 5  Performance 4 (Because phone becomes slightly slow while performing multiple functions)  Camera 4 (Because night clicks are not at all up to the mark, daylight shots are clean but you get best quality only in 64 pixel shots, normal clicks would have been better)  Battery 5 absolutely amazing.

13805,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources.

13808,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
13809,5,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes. Camera quality is excellent only lag of focus white shooting videos. UI is pure no adds, no third party apps. Overall performance is good. I am writing this after using for more than 20 days."
13810,4,"Its a good phone for the price. Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good. One ..."
13811,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
13812,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
13813,5,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
13814,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
13815,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
13816,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
13817,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
13818,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
13819,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
13820,1,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
13821,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
13822,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
13823,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
13824,4,Hmm... Well it's good for less usage definitely not recommending to people who always stick on their phonesüçÅ best for mothers and grandparents kind of...
13825,5,Wonderful product of Motorola G30 very best quality and best performance really i am very happy to purchase this product fully satisfied in this prices Very very thank you so much flippant. Com online shopping companies are very best and bileeve for my next shopping programs
13826,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."

13828,5,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."

Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again. Motorola need to work on processing speed otherwise it's just waste of money. 2. Brightness: Very week. Bt ..."
13837,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand.

13838,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
13839,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.
13840,3,"Recommended only for those who are love stock android experience. G30's camera and screen resolution üëéüëéüëé My 1st aim to buy these phone for stock android experience.

13843,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.

13846,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

13924,1,"Camera quality is okay but pics/vids occupy more space than expected as per the quality of photos.It provides no gallery of its own that's very annoying.Overall phone is less customisable. 64GB for 11k is really expensive, out of which only 48Gb is usable, it isn't Value for Money tbh."

Almost using 100+ apps on it . Touch & screen quality is best. Hybrid sim slots but am using two sims instead of MMC card. Finger print sensor is a quick. Face unlock is a bit slow. Have played games without a lag ...I have ordered dark pearl 64 gb ."
13944,4,Awesome phone.. Thanks Flipkart

13949,1,"Until now I used Moto G (Firsts Generation) for almost 7 years now and it still works like a charm.. but to upgrade I bought this new Moto G30 thinking it is going to be far better than its predecessors, but it's the worst phone ever by motorola. It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."

At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."
13954,1,"Hybrid slot, not good compare to other phones. Camera also not good. Hanging problem"
13955,5,Very best quality
13956,1,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
13957,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."

Display is not HD+, for this price they can at least provide HD+ display.  Final verdict: Good mobile packed with everything for a reasonable price."

13988,4,Overall Good phone
13989,5,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
13990,4,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
13991,2,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...

13996,5,Nice Phone but camera quality is not too good
13997,3,Camera is 64mp but its not good .clearity of camera was disappointed... Not upto the mark and picture clearity is not good. Worst camera clearity and features.

14040,1,Battery not working due to unavoidable reason I am not able to replacement within 7 day (stringent policy of 7 day even in Pendamic)
14041,2,I am not satisfied this product
14042,1,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
14043,2,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
14044,1,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
14045,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
14046,1,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
14047,5,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.

14053,3,"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
14054,1,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
14055,3,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."
14056,3,Average performance
14057,1,Camera quality is poor...don't buy from flipkart..they don't refund the money

14066,1,"Mobile hanging, while Gpay barcode scanner unable to scan again hang, after taking image, while image open again hang, sound on full volume became broken speaker like sound come, one Sim and one memory card or 2 Sim at a time, camera image size around 4-5mb by which stores more space on mobile memory. selfy camera image quality not good"
14067,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
14068,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
14069,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .
14070,1,Very bad performance app shut on its own i complained but no response from company very bad services

14074,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
14075,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
14076,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
14077,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
14078,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
14079,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

14086,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
14087,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."
14088,3,"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

14149,2,Battery drains quickly. doesn't have the impression of 5k mah battery. It provides only 22 hrs with minimal usage and discharges from 14 to 20 percent during night even no apps running in background and mobile data is off. Also has heating issue as the temperature raises up to 46 celcius with light game only. Tried to replace the product but very poor benchmarking during evaluation. My fate to use.

14326,5,Great Phone for the price especially for those who want an Adfree/ bloat free experience. I bought this for my mom and I don't want to bother her with Adwares and other creepy apps.  Snapdragon 662 is snappy for everyday use and also for playing some heavy games at medium settings. The HD+ IPS display is bright with good color reproduction and brightness. 90 Hz refresh rate is an added advantage. Camera is not that great but good. The processor is capable of 4K video record...

14476,5,Review after using for 3 months:  Pros: 1. Definitely lives up to motorola's legacy of solid build quality 2. Awesome performance without any overheating (1 hour of BGMI makes it heat slightly but not overheat) 3. Superb battery life (consumed only 3% battery on playing BGMI for 30m) 4. Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1. Camera is decent overall with great shots in day and night light but performs...

Display- brightness is slightly on lower side but good enough for indoor use. 90 hz provides smooth experience. Performance - satisfactory and runs games like BGMI smoothly. Stock android is its USP. No bloatwares and secure. Fingerprint scanner is not quick though. Battery- can easily last a day for an average user. Value for money- personally I think it is best in its segment. ..."

15210,1,This phone is weird. Battery life is ok for one month only then it gets worse. Screen brightness is low compared to AMOLED screens. DO NOT buy it for gaming because the performance is poor and also the google assistant button gets in the way. If you turn the phone then the speaker gets covered and I think its the biggest blunder in this phone by Motorola. I have owned more than 10 Motorola phones and I think this one is the worst.
15211,1,"Diled or receive mob. no. automatically change in unusual no like 888888, 3059. 3060"

15260,1,Never purchase motorola handsets it's now 1.5 months handset is not getting repaired. Earlier they were saying parts are not there for handset in warranty now they are saying it will take one more day one more day.
15261,5,Moto lovers its good not bad.

15278,3,Cons: 1. Camera is average. Dynamic range is low. Colour is also not accurate. 2. Too heavy. 3. Too big for one hand use. 4. Thickness is high.

Clean and smooth UI 2. Good battery and fast charging 3. Water resistant

15280,1,Worst camera

15342,1,"Motorola has made a good effort to provide a phone in this price range. Overall phone performance is very good in this price. Display is good, battery is good, looks so good, new type of back going feature is nice, Misty blue color is awesome. But they're some issues with the phone which I want to share. The camera quality is very poor. If take a photo in sunlight is good but in little bit in dark photos are very bad. Camera quality is not up to mark. If I think 48 megapixel will work no it w..."
15343,5,In this price range this is one of the best smartphone available on flikart. The camera is also good with night vision available.
15344,4,Best budget friendly mobile from Moto. The display is quite big and not fit in one hand easily. The camera is much better than Samsung mobile of same range and battery performance is good too.If you like big screen with in 10k you can go for this .
15345,1,"The phone is very bad in all aspects . To start with.  1. Camera : The cameras both front and Back are very bad , blurred and low light and no clarity. They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4. FlipKart: Product look's like a duplicate product, and flipkart return policy is worst, there is no returns and refund for the product purchased  My humble suggestion please do not see the ratings..."
15346,4,"The display is good, the phone has good weight, feels solid in hand, the processor is decent for day to day use(browsing, internet surfing, etc.) I brought this for my mother and she is happy with it."
15347,1,"Being a Moto user and Moto lover since 6 years, I must say I'm disappointed. Very bad experience with Moto e7 plus since 2 months. Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."
15348,4,"Thanks to Flipkart for excellent packaging with advanced delivery as l have uploaded pictures of my product...Camera is not at all bad, battery nice also..but the signal quality is,it seems to me, little bit poor..May be l am wrong...overall the product is under satisfaction.."

15352,3,"Overall this phone is great but there are so many features that are missing like audio recording, fm, etc. The most annoying feature is call recording come on why do someone need to know that im recording the call. As soon as you click record it loudly say 'the call is been recorded' except that everything is fine. Camera is good, display is HD+ hardly you will notice any difference. Battery is decent, I like this phone for the UI."

15356,5,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."
15357,5,Good product Worth for its pricing Nice camera especially night mode very helpfull Decent front camera Battery too good Display ok but if they would have given FHD + great Not for gamers Feels good for daily usage with moto gestures No Ads..

Full value for money. 50% Battery stands upto 8 hours of YouTube usage (I would recharge when it comes 50% battery). So with internet usage it will come upto 16 hours or more. Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

17392,3,Although the stock android experience is amazing it is to be noted that the reception on the phone is very weak given the fact that other phones give much superior results with the same sim.  A big flaw since that's the prime goal of a cell phone.

Battery :- battery life is quit good but the charger is very poor quality it feels like keypad phones charger. Display :- display is not that smooth but it's good in this price. Looks :- the overall look of the phone is really good you can't tell the price by it's looks . Overall :- the product is really good but I'm not going to say excellent and I'll update if I like or dislike ...

17788,4,"Don't believe on YouTube reviews, I'm using this mobile and it's a good phone. If you are looking for a mobile phone for your parents then this can be an excellent choice. It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."

18266,5,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time. The best part of this device is its premium feel in this range with the solid packaging of the device qhen you use it continuously. It has a stock Google Android experience with updates directly from Google for the next two years similar to all stock A...

18270,3,With this price range it's a good phone but the face recognition doesn't perform at well in low light and the rare cam doesn't perform at 48 mp instead it works on 32 mp. But for call and video watching and social networking it's doing well. Can't handel heavy games like COD but doing great for candy crush and angry bird. Now upto u. For minimal gaming it's good .
18271,5,Very nice camera & battery backup
18272,4,"Value for price , camera quality is not good."
18273,2,Within 10 days of use this phone started lagging even on basic use like call whatsapp instagram. User interface blanks up after every call.

18704,3,It is just like 16mps camera
18705,3,Camera quality it's like not 48mp it's 13mp but mobile is working good
18706,3,"Camera is not of 48Mp totally cheated by manufacturer. Phone is for average use, Screen is long, battery backup is average is not up to 5000mah, camera resolution is 48 mexa pixel is totally rubbish. Earlier Moto camera of 8MP is far better than48 MP, screen touches is average. Manufacturer are cheating consumer on 48 MP camera there is no any quality check. Think before to buy it is better to purchase from market. They shows demo of every items."

Phone is good except Camera of the phone. Front camera is just like VGA camera . I am one of the very old customer of Motorola but not expected like this from this brand.
18726,2,Front camera is worst in the price range.
18727,1,"This phone has number of issues. I bought it a 3 weeks before, Alarm system is not working at all.It has sound issue while during the call. Many other frequent problems occurs. I stopped buying products from filpcart."

18737,5,Good product delivered by Flipkart
18738,4,Phone is good but nowadays phone screens are too big. We can call phones tablet lite version. Not handy Night vision camera is too good. But day light images are ok ok. Rest all is good but little bit heavy. I request motorola to make handy phone because moto phones are too heavy and strong plus big screens make the phone little bit unhandy....
18739,4,Ok
18740,4,"Overall performance good. But some features missing like vibrate when answered,apps lock. Front camera performance average.back camera performance good. Battery backup & display awasome."

18755,4,Best pure Android mobile under 10k (I bought it for 8100) without any add or unnecessary apps. Super camera. Overall good. Only one thing is low power charger. Better to buy higher power charger to charge quickly.

18762,5,Display: One gets a very clear display on this device. Good for streaming and gaming.  Battery: Little disappointed by the battery. Says it 5000mAh but doesn't last that long. Though it's good.  Camera: set the camera manually and the results are amazing. Slow motion videos are pretty good. Also Selfie camera is impressive.  Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
18763,5,Best phone in this price
18764,5,Best budget phone in this price
18765,4,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
18766,3,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

18858,5,"Purchased the Moto G9 and Moto E7 plus in Big Billion Day. Moto E7 plus has many cost cuttings - micro USB charge point, No Fast Charging support. No case in Box, No Secondary Microphone But it Takes better photos than the MOTO G9!!! It blows my mind. Compared Well lit and Low lit Photos. In Moto E7 plus, I just have to take a single shot and can expect the photos to look good whereas there is focusing issues in the G9."

18897,1,Received today...Ok as of now will review after a week usage Everyday I am hating this mobile after 2 weeks Iam done..such waste from motorola... Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
18898,4,Very good product
18899,5,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
18900,3,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
18901,5,Overall superb mobile at this price
18902,4,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it
18903,3,Product is good but delivery was late
18904,1,Bad camera of back side..it has mirrarcast problem in all phones..I think some of money will west to invest.. My suggestion is don't to buy did product

18919,5,Nice product. All are good
18920,5,"Excellent, price worthy"
18921,5,Best phone ever with no junk under 10k with new Snapdragon 460 processor and solid body.
18922,5,Nice model for mid range users...
18923,5,Better
18924,1,Camera is cheap
18925,4,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
18926,4,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
18927,4,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."
18928,5,Nice phone

18942,5,Very good at price 8099 rupees
18943,5,EXCELLENT
18944,5,Phone is so cool and amazing looking and camera design lika a iphone series And value of money is osm Battery too good And camera not bad rear osmm and front camera night time photo is bad click but go to the out of home in sunshine then you feel like a pro phone Overall gud phone üëçüëå
18945,1,"Don't buy this phone, in this phone brightness is very low quality, front camera is very poor. Battery backup is also of poor quality."
18946,5,Ok Ok
18947,5,Nice phone...
18948,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
18949,1,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
18950,5,Good products üëç
18951,5,"Super, Value for money.."
18952,5,Most mind choice mobile
18953,5,Stock android no bloatwares and a decent camera. All in all a good buy.
18954,5,Great product for this price tag!
18955,4,Good in price
18956,5,Budget king
18957,4,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
18958,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
18959,5,Awesome product
18960,2,do not buy completely waste this product
18961,5,Just awesome
18962,4,It is amazing mobile
18963,5,Nice but company should provide earphones also
18964,4,Alike professional
18965,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
18966,4,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
18967,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.
18968,5,Good mobile

19320,2,My left ear piece is making crackle noise other than that sound quality is good 1.Bass is ok not for bass lovers 2.Mid's is best for the price. 3.Best performance is at 60 to 70 % of volume above that music gets a bit rough 4.Best in quality . 5.only for melody songs. Returned only for that crackle noise from Left ear piece
19321,1,"Its very bd sound quality , too long wire , plastic quality also bad"
19322,1,Worst product ever bought will say never ever go for any mivi product  ** After 2 months of use Will say  This thing has one of the cheapest build quality  They have just a piece of cloth to cover the internal parts under the ear buds  Magnet stopped working  User experience uncomfortable to wear for more than 1 hours will feel irritation and uneasiness not at all comfortable.  My earphones stopped working connected them but the warranty claim process is so bad 1 2 week passed but I am jus...
19323,3,I don't like the sound quality . I expected much more than this from mivi but i don't feel bass also and the volume is also not good. It should be upto a level but unfortunately it wasn't. The magnet is also not good. That's why i am returning this product

19638,4,If you are music listener for long hours on mobile or iPad this model is not recommended. For calling purpose and others it is good.

19641,5,Sometimes it seems that such a good thing can be found at such a low price The company claims 24 hours of charge but lasts an average of 15-20 hours.The sound is also good at this price.It would be useless to compare this with an expensive product

25000,1,Waste of money. Broken in a week
25001,1,3rd class product...battery was not there in the box
25002,3,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
25003,5,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
25004,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
25005,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
25006,4,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
25007,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
25008,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
25009,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
25010,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
25011,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
25012,3,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
25013,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
25014,4,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
25015,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
25016,4,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
25017,5,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
25018,4,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
25019,1,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
25020,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
25021,4,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
25022,4,wonderful product
25023,3,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
25024,5,awesome.
25025,1,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
25026,1,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
25027,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
25028,4,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
25029,5,good
25030,5,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
25031,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
25032,3,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
25033,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
25034,4,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
25035,5,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
25036,5,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
25037,4,Great watch to wear üëå
25038,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...
25039,2,"Received duplicate straps (Belt) within 6 to 8 month both belts cut down automatically..... Watch is good, belt cost is 3k...."
25040,5,Loved it
25041,1,"BPM feature is not working, wifi is not getting connected, notification feature fails"
25042,1,they gave used product
25043,4,it's good.
25044,5,nice smartwatch..
25045,4,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
25046,1,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
25047,1,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
25048,1,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
25049,4,Good Product
25050,3,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
25051,5,Nice product
25052,3,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
25053,3,Writing this review after using the product for 9 months . The watch used to work almost satisfactorily for most of the period but there was some noticeable glitch in tracking the heart rate on many occasions . After 09 months it's recording of heart rate became completely erratic . It is abnormally high even during sleep . This error has made the watch completely useless as all the vital stats and features are dependent on accurate tracking of heart rate only .
25054,5,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
25055,1,Not supporting for Notifications.
25056,4,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
25057,2,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
25058,4,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
25059,4,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
25060,1,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
25061,3,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
25062,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
25063,5,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
25064,1,not support all mobile model
25065,1,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
25066,2,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
25067,4,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
25068,5,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
25069,5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
25070,5,It's a good watch.
25071,2,Very inaccurate and unreliable
25072,5,Good product value for money
25073,5,Full features for this cost is value for money
25074,2,Not good start problem ha
25075,5,Value for money. Good product
25076,4,Ok
25077,3,"The activity tracking is good. But the watch's battery is terrible and barely lasts 2 days. Also, the mechanism to remove and attach the straps is the worst."
25078,1,Battery melted in 2 month time and not getting any support from any where.. flipkart customer support is just waste.. they promise to call in some time but never turned up.. facing issue from 1 month but no prevail. Dont purchase any item like that frm flipkart.
25079,5,Just premium awesome
25080,1,Worst quality of Band...... And accessories not available in local market..... I waste my money after 1 month of use..
25081,3,Battery is draining fast
25082,5,Very good. No compromise on Fitbit quality. Good deal.
25083,3,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
25084,4,Value for money
25085,2,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
25086,4,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
25087,5,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
25088,3,Just okay
25089,5,Excellent watch.
25090,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
25091,3,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
25092,2,Connectivity is very loose
25093,5,Good product
25094,1,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
25095,5,Good product... resonable price...
25096,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
25097,1,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
25098,5,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
25099,3,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
25100,1,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
25101,2,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
25102,5,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
25103,5,Very nice
25104,5,This watch was Awesome
25105,5,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
25106,2,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
25107,5,Worth buying it
25108,5,It is a good product in this price range.
25109,3,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
25110,1,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
25111,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
25112,1,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
25113,5,It's an amazing product
25114,2,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
25115,3,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
25116,2,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
25117,2,Poor battery backup
25118,5,Best watch
25119,5,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
25120,4,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
25121,5,Worth buy and accurate
25122,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
25123,2,Bettery keep charging every day
25124,2,After one year display automatically damaged
25125,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
25126,1,Worst product no recommended
25127,4,Good watch...looks stylish...
25128,5,Beautiful watch...value for money.
25129,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
25130,5,Good one
25131,1,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
25132,3,Okay product
25133,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
25134,1,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
25135,5,Awsome experience....
25136,5,Good watch
25137,4,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
25138,1,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
25139,2,Not good
25140,1,Waste of buying
25141,5,Nice watch
25142,5,Very nice product...üëç
25143,4,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
25144,3,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
25145,4,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
25146,1,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
25147,1,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
25148,5,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
25149,5,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
25150,4,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
25151,2,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
25152,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
25153,1,Not good
25154,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
25155,4,Good watch
25156,1,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
25157,4,Worth it....
25158,1,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
25159,5,Nice
25160,5,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
25161,4,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
25162,5,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
25163,4,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
25164,5,Great product!!
25165,2,Not value for money..
25166,4,Nice watch
25167,5,Amazing
25168,5,Its value for money
25169,5,Thank you flipkart
25170,2,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
25171,3,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
25172,4,It‚Äôs okay
25173,1,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
25174,5,Good So far...Loving it
25175,5,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
25176,5,Very good
25177,4,Classic watch
25178,5,Good product
25179,5,It's wow
25180,4,Classy product.but battery issue seen
25181,5,Nice watch.....
25182,4,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
25183,5,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
25184,3,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
25185,5,Nice
25186,2,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
25187,5,Nice one
25188,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
25189,1,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
25190,2,Don't buy
25191,4,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
25192,1,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
25193,2,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
25194,5,Wonderful bought at 7300
25195,4,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
25196,4,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
25197,3,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
25198,4,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
25199,1,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
25200,1,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
25201,5,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
25202,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
25203,5,Best at this price
25204,4,Good Simple watch.
25205,1,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
25206,5,Nice
25207,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
25208,5,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
25209,3,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
25210,3,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
25211,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
25212,1,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
25213,5,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
25214,2,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
25215,5,Very nice really good product
25216,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
25217,1,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
25218,5,No doubt... It's best in class
25219,5,Good one
25220,1,Worst product
25221,1,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
25222,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
25223,3,Not much as expected
25224,5,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
25225,5,Best in class
25226,1,Worst don't buy it
25227,1,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
25228,1,This product waste
25229,1,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
25230,1,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
25231,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
25232,2,Not worth of the price
25233,1,syncing problem with iphone
25234,5,Amazing watch!
25235,2,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
25236,1,Poor
25237,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
25238,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
25239,3,Breakage product
25240,1,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
25241,4,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
25242,1,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
25243,2,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
25244,5,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
25245,5,Good product received and worth of money.
25246,1,Totally inaccurate!
25247,4,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
25248,4,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
25249,5,Great watch..durable too
25250,5,Loved it
25251,5,Nice
25252,5,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
25253,2,Money waste
25254,1,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
25255,5,Nyc
25256,5,Very good product
25257,4,Nice watch
25258,4,Nice product
25259,5,Perfect

25261,4,good
25262,1,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
25263,3,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
25264,5,Berry ghatiya product
25265,3,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
25266,4,worth to spend on this product
25267,5,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
25268,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
25269,1,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
25270,5,amazing product
25271,5,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
25272,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
25273,1,dont buy this watch. worst product
25274,5,Supergood.
25275,5,best
25276,2,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
25277,5,nice
25278,5,Papa is very happy with the watch
25279,5,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
25280,2,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
25281,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
25282,3,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
25283,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
25284,1,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
25285,5,super
25286,5,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
25287,4,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
25288,5,great product
25289,5,I just have praises for this watch
25290,4,base users for a activity trackers
25291,5,loving it.
25292,4,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
25293,1,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
25294,1,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
25295,4,good in all aspects.
25296,1,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
25297,2,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
25298,4,ok
25299,1,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
25300,4,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
25301,5,very good product...
25302,1,Connectivity issue.
25303,4,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
25304,2,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
25305,5,super watch and nice color
25306,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
25307,4,good one
25308,2,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
25309,4,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
25310,2,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
25311,1,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
25312,5,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
25313,5,good one
25314,5,good and accurate
25315,2,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
25316,5,very good
25317,1,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
25318,4,Really good watch worth buying
25319,1,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
25320,1,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
25321,5,worth buying....
25322,1,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
25323,1,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
25324,3,working as per review but little costly
25325,3,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
25326,3,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
25327,5,nice product....
25328,1,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
25329,5,perfect for health reasons
25330,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
25331,5,go for it guys rocking
25332,1,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
25333,4,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
25334,1,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
25335,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
25336,5,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
25337,5,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
25338,1,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
25339,4,good
25340,2,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
25341,1,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
25342,5,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
25343,1,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
25344,5,great product
25345,2,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
25346,4,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
25347,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
25348,4,very good product with great features
25349,4,good watch.... only lacking call facility
25350,5,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
25351,2,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
25352,1,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
25353,1,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
25354,3,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
25355,5,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
25356,2,The product was not as per expectation.
25357,5,genuine product
25358,5,Great product
25359,3,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
25360,5,Nice Watch for the Amount
25361,5,awesome.....
25362,3,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
25363,5,Excellent product... good to go
25364,5,nice product
25365,2,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
25366,1,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
25367,1,worst watch
25368,4,stylish and fantastic
25369,4,ok
25370,5,excellent watch
25371,5,best price and good buy
25372,4,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
25373,5,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
25374,3,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
25375,5,Good
25376,2,"Terrible setup experience. Nothing works seamlessly. And Linux is not supported for music uploads, etc."
25377,1,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !
25378,1,Not connecting for not working properly
25379,5,Nice product
25380,5,very nice
25381,1,Not fully compatible with one plus 6T. Having Notification issue.
25382,3,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
25383,5,Nice watch
25384,1,Very poor quality. Has completely gone dead in one day of usage after factory resetting. Wastage of money.
25385,5,Product is good....look and Activities tracking is nice.
25386,4,beautiful watch
25387,5,Trustworthy companion throughout the clock
25388,4,cool

25391,5,good one
25392,5,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .
25393,3,Satisfied with the product.. Its a really good for all who wants to learn photography its a gem and love.... Go for itt....10/10
25394,5,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.
25395,4,The camera simply awesome..and it is a best budget DSLR and begginer DSLR for first time user...auto focus mode works good in daylight
25396,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode
25397,4,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
25398,4,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
25399,5,"product is very good and build quality also , special thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery , best camera for starters , it captures best quality photos"
25400,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
25401,5,Verry Nice and for My Opinion is great camera For this Price Range. I love it my first DSLR...! üëç Lot of Experiments Is easy with This DSLR .üòé

25406,5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
25407,5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
25408,5,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
25409,4,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
25410,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
25411,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
25412,5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."

TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
25414,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
25415,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret.

25420,5,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
25421,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
25422,3,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
25423,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
25424,5,"A decent entry level DSLR. Very glad that it was bundled with a carry case.  The lens is decent for beginner level and some advanced level photography.  For the price I bought it, I can not say how glad I am."
25425,4,I think best product in this prize totally worth it üî•. But you don't get bag Or memory card that's why I gave 4star
25426,1,"This is my first camera in my life. After 3months research i bought camera from Flipkart through EMI . Camera received on republic day . I am very happy to see the first camera in my life . All happiness gone after 10minutes of usage due to camera view finder don't have diopter adjustment as per various human vision so I faced eye irritation,severe headache, blurred vision.cannon kindly consider this is design problem and also bad entry level camera. View finder quality is must must must......."
25427,5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
25428,5,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"
25429,4,this is the best DSLR for beginer the price is the best DSLR best for the beginer I am really happy for this camera
25430,3,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.

25432,5,Nyc osm fantastic Fabulous pictures quality ls vary vary good in this price range I m gone for 5 star thank you flipkart thank you so much for this camera
25433,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
25434,5,Very nice camera üì∏ for beginners and picture quality is very good and it's worth buying and build quality is very good üëçüëå And Best camera for family üòä I use this camera from 1 month and I am very satisfied with the camera üì∏ and worth buying with 18-55 lens
25435,5,"I purchased this last in the month of October after using roughly almost 7-8 months I can say this camera is a gem for beginners and for pro guys you'll not dissatisfied with the quality of camera , image capture quality. good battery backup high quality lense high quality cables even carry case is also good yeah bag looks little old fashioned but who cares about the bag when you have very decent camera at this price range"
25436,4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."
25437,4,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
25438,4,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
25439,4,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
25440,5,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
25441,5,A full featured DSLR with a good quality image sensor. It has all the features that are required for a mid level amateur. In skilled hands it is an awesome tool.
25442,4,"Best Entry Level DSLR in this range. My first DSLR. Loved It. Good delivery, thank you Flipkart !"
25443,5,As like always Canon is perfect in all manner.. super pick by this price range. loved it
25444,5,"Nice Camera in Great Price, Good for photo passionate"

25447,3,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
25448,5,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
25449,5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
25450,5,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
25451,4,it's awesome gift... always thnkful papa..I feel very happy .. it's good working...and very clean photo..
25452,5,"Happy with the product and quality of the image is also awesome for the beginners.., got free wireless head phone.. thanks üòÉ"
25453,5,Product worth for money. nice clarity and amazing snaps
25454,5,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
25455,5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
25456,4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
25457,5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
25458,5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
25459,5,Very Good Result But Not For Photographer in Studio Use . Studio Light Triger Nit Supported But Family Use Best Camera Under 25 k
25460,5,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.
25461,5,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
25462,4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
25463,4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
25464,4,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
25465,5,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"
25466,5,Good quality product for the price. Photo quality is commendable and iinbuilt wifi is an advantage as it can be used to wirelessly use camera for capture and data transfer. Even the video quality is very nice at1080p.
25467,5,awesome product very good . thank you flipkart for awesome discount

25603,1,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...

25725,5,Good
25726,5,Good for the price but I would suggest if you have money then go for 1500d. Can capture decent picture but the display size and color production is very poor if you compare it with 1300d or 1500d.  I have attached some sample shots. For more sample shots you can visit (Abhinav____ on instagram)

25786,1,MEMORY CARD NOT RECEIVED
25787,5,nice photo
25788,2,"Don't fall in trap with the price,get a used camera,that would be a better option.U can get a 600d or 700d or sony a5100 in this price range with 18-55mm and a 55-250m lens.Think about the future use,u can not plug in mic,it does not have autofocus u can not record videos at 60fps in 1080p also its low light performance is worst.Please don't buy this.Ibought it and now i am regretting."
25789,1,It's not supporting memory card I have changed so many memory cards but nothing is supporting and two times pick master have denied to take back the product saying that the serial numbers of the product is showing invalid in his device

25800,5,Amazing üòç but should have provided a bag too.
25801,5,Lovely üì∑ üíê
25802,3,Camera is super but kindly provide bag and MEMORY Card
25803,5,Nice camera
25804,4,It‚Äôs worth the Price .. leave the kit lens Have to buy separate lens which will b too good with EOS 3000D

25816,5,Very nice camera... But main thing is that I don't know some of its functions so after using 3-4 months I will give my review again
25817,5,Blur system is very good
25818,4,Good
25819,5,Good product
25820,5,So Nice.I love this
25821,3,Camera is good but storage is not enough camera quality is very nice this is expensive but according to price features very less.
25822,4,Good product for the price range.
25823,5,Super üíï
25824,5,Awesome product i.e. dslr camera at this price . I am using it since 5 months..
25825,4,Awesome in this price range great quality
25826,5,Good
25827,5,Very good photo
25828,1,Wast of mony
25829,5,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
25830,5,Best dslr in low Price
25831,5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
25832,4,Excellent product
25833,5,Always guves a crisp image. Best for beginner. And I am a beginner.
25834,3,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
25835,4,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
25836,4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."
25837,5,At this price..it is okay.but if you are expecting professional quality fotography then it is not for you..Go for some higher price model.
25838,5,Good product
25839,4,Excellent product the picture is much more good
25840,5,Very good
25841,5,Nice
25842,5,Good for entry level. I bought is super cheap at 19k. Wait for offers.. if want a bit better one go for 1500d

25967,4,Thank Q. I recived it in time and good one.but we brought for our personal use and we need demo wher should we go

25969,5,nice product and on time delivery by flipkart thank u . packed well
25970,1,Very poor quality
25971,1,"Worst product for those who prefers video recording,they haven't mentioned it in description also,even the display size is less than the lower model 1300.it is simply waste. Better to go with some products of nikon."
25972,1,camera is good but the headset which they provided was 2 year older.. i went for this camera because of that moto headset only.. finally i got old which seems less durable.. i should have went for 1500d..üòêüòêüòê waste of 1000 rupees extra for tat headset
25973,5,1500d is batter than 3000d i have expressed both 1500d have batter functions than 3000 before buy compare led size auto open flash and one click on and off option awailable
25974,1,"Very low resolution, it's not useful"
25975,4,"One of the best DSLR cameras for the beginners although I don't know much about photography took this camera as it was there in incredible deal of 20,000. The camera has no built in flash you have to buy a seperate flasher from the market or from Flipkart. The packing and the delivery from flipkart was smooth."

26004,4,"Overall product is good. Light weight, easy to handle. The only issue is, in description. They said there is 30x optical zoom whereas it only zoom upto 3x with 18-55mm lens, so it is my humble request to FLIPKART sales team to review the description once on their end before putting it on website."

There's no separate power button and viewfinder diopter , it's of a bit problem. Nevertheless , it's the most affordable dslr in the market , and it can compete with any entry level dslr. Thus it's the best pick for a beginner."

26776,2,"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot..."

After you will be used to this product then you will feel like you have to upgrade but you may not be able to buy the new one. So, go for Canon 1500D if you are buying this, if you can't afford that, then you may go for this one. At last you are the user, you must know what to buy, Do some research on what you really need."

27584,5,"I'm not good photographer, so with my limited knowledge and usage, I'd say camera is more than value for money. Yes, pics quality is good, in both day & night (using flash). A lens and a camera kit bag which comes as supplement is an added benefit to carry & handle the camera safer during outing. Needless to say flipkart's service as it was delivered as promised!!!! Overall, considering it's price,this camera basic DSLR model, will be useful for the beginners."

28691,5,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
28692,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
28693,5,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
28694,5,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
28695,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
28696,5,"Excellent wow, what a camera! value for money, must buy. best entry lebel camera. flipkart delivery is so fast. very good packaging. no 1 genuine product."
28697,4,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...
28698,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
28699,4,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
28700,4,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
28701,5,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
28702,4,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
28703,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
28704,5,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
28705,5,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
28706,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
28707,5,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
28708,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
28709,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
28710,5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
28711,4,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
28712,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
28713,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
28714,5,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
28715,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
28716,5,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."
28717,5,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price.

28719,5,"Great Camera !!! Took Some Time To understand all the basics of photography... its giving good quality pictures. I shoot raw, and post processing the images are coming really well Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me ... 300mm lens is ok... need to get another one since i mostly do birds..need more zoom ‚ò∫Ô∏è overall its a great Camera for beginners!!!"
28720,5,Very nice camera
28721,5,"Best DSLR üì∏ on this range üí∞, I think nikon provide best product in DSLR. Picture was so good I just love with this DSLR"
28722,5,Awosome photography.
28723,5,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
28724,5,Camera nd picture qlty is so nice. Delivery is also fine. This camera fullfill all the need. It work fine nd battery backup also fine. Nikon is best for Picture Quality and colours.
28725,4,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
28726,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
28727,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
28728,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
28729,4,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
28730,5,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
28731,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
28732,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
28733,5,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
28734,5,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
28735,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
28736,4,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
28737,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
28738,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
28739,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
28740,5,Great product from flipkart and delivery period is very short I just loved flipkart delivery time period.... And also I wants to thank flipkart for the free gift of Samsung Bluetooth headfone.. And have got the Bluetooth headset with the nikon d5600....now just wants to click and enjoy my photography with the camera....
28741,5,"This one is master of Photography with Dual Kit Lens set, it is an amazing tool... awesome picture quality.  good sensor, nice shutter speed, larger range of ISO variation, 60fps video @1080P...makes it an awesome camera"
28742,3,"camera is 5 *, you can read enough on the net. Got at a very good deal , seller also shipped it on time but the courier ecom express delivered late , the outside box (carton ) was also damaged. Thankfully the inside packaging was good enough to prevent any damage. Flipkart and seller should ensure they send it via a reliable courier. I guess people will be willing to pay shipment to see their expensive items delivered on time and w/o damage. Btw I didnt receive any samsung headphone with the ..."
28743,5,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
28744,5,Really a joy to use. Very good camera to start with. It is my first DSLR and I am really very happy with the images and the focus. Good for photography to begin with. Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera?
28745,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
28746,5,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."
28747,5,"superb DSLR ,brought for my daughter very good pic. quality nd video quality with good sound,go for it without any ifs nd buts....... ...u will definitely like this product...."
28748,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!
28749,5,"Before time delivery, great service flipkart... Product is great as expected... Good discount... Nice packaging, Got wellness band free... Delighted"
28750,5,Bought the camera in a perfect deal. A nice cam that suits beginner to pro users with a lot many handy features. The 18-55 kit lens delivers a promising performance. I'm very much satisfied with it. Thanks Flipkart for a great deal.
28751,5,Amazing product if one has the budget he should buy this camera with the dual lens because the combo pack is so good. The components was not even touched. and the components were also very clean and brand new the only thing that which I don't like is the proper bill with the guarantee warranty card. I don't get the warranty card inside the box so please mention that point overall the camera was good all the components for not even touched very clean and I will give this product 5 rates. Thank...
28752,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
28753,5,"I am writing this review after using one month. I have bought the camera at 42k with the dslr body & and 18-55mm kit lens. The image quality of this camera is really awesome & amd the kit lens works really well. Low light photography is preety good. If you're a beginner like me, this camera's functions would be slightly complicated but after a little bit experience, you'll be able to capture great quality pictures even without external equipments. I'll highly recommend you to buy this product..."
28754,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."

28768,5,"Well my review is supposed to be rated 4.5 rather than a 5, if I wrote this review without using the camera first. This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."

28791,4,Nice DSLR. Bag provided is Lowepro NOT Nikon. But lowepro bag is of very good quality. There are two lenses.

We advise you to check the warranty entitlements of the products sold through e-commerce websites/ portals under the brand name ‚ÄòNikon‚Äô. But this was posted in their site on 09-09-2015.

29026,3,"Everything in the camera is good, but if you buy this from store, a Samsung bluetooth headset worth Rs 3000 is complementary with any DSLR camera, but if you buy from here seller doesn't send the bluetooth headset. This is the cheating as nikon himself is giving complementary headset, then what is the problem with seller for sending the same. Camera is fantastic and both the lenses are working superb. Thanks"
29027,5,NICEEEE CAMERA
29028,5,"In the Entry level DSLR category, this is the best option. D5600 is compared to 200D, but in real word 5600 fairs much better in all areas. Go for it!!"

29030,3,camera is fine but the free Samsung Bluetooth headphone was not provided
29031,5,"Everything is ok, but I got a camera backpack instead I wanted a sling bag to carry my camera. Now this sometimes make me uneasy to carry both laptop and camera together. So if you are looking for a backpack with the camera then no doubt, go for it but if you want a sling bag then, i think you should confirm it first from their services. Happy Clicking!"

29286,5,I am Very happy for my new Nikon DSLR Camera. It is in good working condition.
29287,4,Its been two days since I started using the camera. First thing to say is that I didn't get bag along with the product. They could have provided a bag as its a costly dslr. Some people said they got a headphone along with the product. I don't have any complaint about not getting the headphone. But carry bag is an essential accessory. 4 star only for this reason. Otherwise no complaints. It's a good product as we know.

As you never know which lens you may need. 70-300 gives you great pictures. I always intend to use it only.

Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's. You can refill the cartridge at home in the kit you get everything just watch a video on YouTube and you will save you 96% Printing cost. I have done the same thi..."
30380,5,"great !! easy to use ,, budget friendly,, good printing quality,, looks comfortable, weight also user friendly"
30381,5,nice product I am a student I ordered this for my work I don't have a computer or a laptop I only have Android phones so I ordered that and now I print the worksheet from this printer very nice printer
30382,5,super Good delivery and canon printer is Good Quality.... value of money.. best product..
30383,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less  So my suggestion to all those people who want...
30384,5,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.  What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges 3. Driver cd  Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.  Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)"
30385,5,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
30386,4,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
30387,4,For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
30388,4,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details . The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes . Yes buying the ink will be expensive . Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
30389,5,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"
30390,1,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high.. So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
30391,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
30392,5,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
30393,5,Amazing printer But cartridge is expansive But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge You can see videos in youtube of cartridge refill By this way you can save your money upto 95 % Once again product is amazing Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
30394,5,"PROS: 1. Available at cheap price. 2. Decent for less amount of printing. 3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.  CONS: 1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included. 2. Print speed is too slow. 3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.  Suggestion: Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink! Happy Printing :)"
30395,5,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.  Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
30396,3,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing. But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..  Btw its a good printer like hp1050
30397,5,This is the 2nd time I am buying this printer. This is a very good printer for ur home and not for heavy usage. I brought this printer again coz refilling of the catriges is very simple and can be done at home. I refilled my previous printer catriges almost 7-8 times. You can get many videos on utube on refilling Cannon pixma catriges. If u buy new cartriges it will cost u around Rs 600-700 for black and Rs 800-900 for colour. It's better if u refill the catriges at home every refilling will ...
30398,3,it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product
30399,4,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good. Cartidge is costly. After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
30400,2,Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...
30401,4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
30402,5,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.  After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.  Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.  Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."
30403,5,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller

30405,2,This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
30406,4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
30407,5,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
30408,4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
30409,4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
30410,2,"it's not good Or not bad,,.. It's work too much slower.. but not bad... it's ink Is not working longer ... I'm not happy with this INK problem... Thanks to Flifkart...."
30411,5,Packing is awsome ! Prints a bit slow but thats good enoght for that price ! Works fine
30412,3,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!  Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects 2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine. 3. Doesn't take much space and sheets Cons : Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ
30413,5,Very nice product in affordable price.delivery was good.packing was awesome .printer working very much fine .
30414,5,This printer has helped a lot in my projects.Tjis is a gorgeous printer that I have never seen.The owner of this printer would be very happy and in a favorable mood since from first day of buying this printer.
30415,5,Superb very friendly for personal use very fast and good quality love it
30416,5,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
30417,1,"It's been a week since I bought the product and still haven't been successful in getting it connected to an android phone. Downloaded two apps and still not done. Such products should have longer duration for returns and should also have refund options. I still haven't managed. If there is anyone to support or guide, pls contact."
30418,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
30419,4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
30420,2,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
30421,5,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."

30423,1,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying. I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed. Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
30424,3,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
30425,3,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful

30434,4,It's Amazing I like this one but the quality is good but it can be better with some improvements
30435,4,"Till now it work very fine ,cartrege ink consume very fast ,otherwise it is good product at this price ,"
30436,5,Printer is very good but ink finished off soon both black and colour The print pages doesn't exceed more than 50 also better to go for laser print

30444,5,super nice and super cool
30445,2,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
30446,5,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks. One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
30447,3,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
30448,4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
30449,5,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
30450,5,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
30451,4,purchased this product a few days back. Recieved on time and it is working perfectly and value for money. the best all in one printer at affordable price. As i know it is the only printer with multi-functions and at such low cost in the market right now. So guys go for it.
30452,5,I'm a student and this printer is so helping me in project works and my many other works of schools. I like it .
30453,5,"The product is good and very easy to use but when we fill ink and use it causes some destructionions s,I wanted to say is it is good but follow instruction from given paper and also check in youtube how to operate and make it work thank uuuu"
30454,4,"good product, nice image printing, good zeros quality, I am Happy this product."

30470,3,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon. Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge. What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised. Another issue is that it doesn'..."

It has few important features like coping, scanning etc. This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge.

30487,4,I just wanted to print documents once in a while. Not a heavy user so it is good for me. It is light weight print quality is also good. Works fine with macbook. Colour is also good and presentable on any desk. If you are a heavy user or need it for professional prints maybe go for higher end models. Wish it was wireless but cant complain much at the price.
30488,4,"This is a printer for normal use... The photocopy and the print quality are good and clear. It does all my works of printing, scanning and photocopy. The only thing that i didnt like is that it makes sounds while printing. However it is an inkjet printer, all inkjet printer does that. Best buy at such price"
30489,5,Being delivering whatever I want from the time I got it. Perfect for home/official use. 2 to 3 months now and still holding up on the initial set of inks. Good product and I do not think one has to think twice for going for it. Delivered on time by Flipkart. Thanks for bringing the product to us.
30490,5,"This one made the life easy from day we bought it, previously it was like draining money for color printouts for kids projects and each color print out costed close to Rs 10. Once we had this printer hooking up was easy with Windows 7 and quick start up and then completing projects by kids was easy. The best was copy part kids can do by them self and color prints from system are as good as any color Xerox .  The only hiccup was ink, which would run out quickly if we do heavy printing, but w..."

30497,4,Printer is good but cartridge capacity is too little.also it does not have led display like PIXMA 258. for multiple xerox copy u cant increase the no of copies from printer itself. you have to take each copy by pressing button again and again and printer will scan same copy everytime. sometime its very frustrating. rest is good and be aware that cartridge will run out of frequently

30523,5,Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. Nice Packing. Printing quality and Photo Print Speed is too good. We cant expect more in this Budget. It crops scanned docs automatically. Its really nice feature time. Overall I m very satisfied with this. And Coming to Ink Cartridges cost is very high. Better to fix ciss ink tank.

30531,4,I got this product on big billion day 2014 for Rs 0.....yes....zero :) Have been using this product since. Works fine till now. The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside. The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...
30532,5,Pros: Cost: The MRP is 3995-/ but in flipkart is cost 2990.  Was well packed and got it on time.  It can be attached to your PC/Tablet.  Easy to configure and use. Drivers can also be found online.  Auto Power On/Off  Cons Printing takes more time

30566,2,Cartridge is costier than printer...only 30 prints from the cartridge....Don't buy it...Spend more money in other products
30567,1,no action print
30568,4,Product is very good....and good quality .... Packing was horrible...
30569,5,Looking good and working system is very nice.
30570,5,too good
30571,4,Awesome product ..
30572,5,value for money product
30573,5,v good product
30574,1,plz dont by this product ink jet is verry cosly black in 500 - 15 pages only and color 800-10 pages only
30575,5,this product as good
30576,4,"cartridges are provided with this printer at the time in box package or not, because this is not specified in the sales"
30577,5,amazing and super thank you filpkart
30578,5,nice work
30579,1,Please don't buy this printer.. the cartridge gets over after 20 prints and scanner sometimes strucks I would like to say you to go for a ink tank printer where you can add inks..
30580,2,wow after 8 months usage i sold this coz iNk prices 60% of the amount of printer !! Keep calm store money go with laser jet or something else which cartridge supports refilling QQ
30581,4,Good
30582,5,very good printer. printing quality is too good.
30583,1,please do not sale
30584,1,Dont buy this product guys this canon peoples are cheeters they dont know to manufacture the good product. i purchased 1 month back this printer. but no use boz it hase mentioned in to the cartrage that you can take 400 print were i took only 10 it showes cartrage is empty and i buyed new one that also same only 10. stop this selling product in to the market. now i need to through this printer to dustbin. do not buy it
30585,1,by using two to three months its getting problems...
30586,1,One cartridge costs around 600(medium) and i am getting 15-18 pages per cartridge ..so approximately i am paying 30rs for a page printout. If you are looking for a scanner...fine go for it. price of printer is inversely proportional to rs you pay for pages. Go for some printer in range of 6k to 7k. In long term you will reap benefit.
30587,5,Very good product
30588,1,Not working properly..
30589,5,well finished pakage and the printer so u can buy it in cheap price.
30590,1,Its cartage will cost you a bomb.Lasts just 10 prints & costs Rs 800/-. Not worth it. Print quality is ok
30591,1,for 1 month it is best printer but after one month it is so costly ink was RS.1000-2000
30592,4,"GOOD, GOOD , GOOD"
30593,1,Not able to print. Alarm lamp is continuously blinking despite correct installation of cartridges and paper alignment.
30594,2,The Black color cartridge can print only around 50-60 papers after that we need to buy a new one which cost around 800.  The print quality is good the cost of refilling is too high
30595,5,I received good product iam satisfied let see the span

30799,1,I have bought this product from flipkart just 4-5 weeks back and I am putting it up on OLX right away. 1. The scanner stops working if your ink runs out. Which is stupid because 2 functions should operate independently (like in HP - i should stuck to the same) 2. One ink cartridge gives only 6-7 full colour prints (i only use it to print pictures for my kid's school projects)\ Very annoying product.
30800,1,hello! please dont buy it this canon printer your lost your money printer is gud but cartage is so expensive colour pirice 1200 and black 1000. total cost 2200 printer cost 2300 and only 180 pages printe in one cartage

31539,3,"Didn't meet expectations. Need to refill very frequently. While refilling it flows out from other end. Very less amount of ink remains inside cartridge resulting in printing for 15-20 papers only. And other issue is, even after refilling cartridge the yellow light will keep blinking. Would say don't go for this product."
31540,1,Faulty cartrige
31541,3,Very expensive
31542,1,"Waste Product, Ink over In 1month"
31543,3,It's really Good
31544,5,Its really good
31545,1,The 745s and 746s cartridges costs are too high for a refill. It comes just for 20 pages. Please rethink before you buy

31573,1,Not worthy & less productive.
31574,5,lovely
31575,1,Never by this product. It is really swindling to rob the credulous customers by selling them a comparatively cheaper printer and then to charge an exorbitant and unaffordable and grossly disproportionate price for the printer cartridges. The printer is never returnable as well. NEVER EVER BUY AND FALL A PREY TO THE SELLERS CUNNING TACTICS.
31576,1,Very bad product. Cartridge finish within 20 pages print. And the cartridge is not refilling. If the cartridge is finished you need to buy a new cartridge Which price is 700 and above. And no. off-page is very less in printing. Almost your per copy print approx Rs10-12 each in black.
31577,1,Printer bad working
31578,1,Very poor not working ink error .even after refilling
31579,5,This printer is very nice
31580,5,"Frankly speaking Guyzz don't buy this as for student purpose/home purpose because the cartridges is too costly and in one cartridge give only 50 sheets Afterall the printer is very good there is no doubt but not for as student purpose overall cost will be 10,000 in that you go for ink tank printers it will save you atleast you don't have to buy costly cartridges. Thank you ."
